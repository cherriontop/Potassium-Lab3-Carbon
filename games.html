		<p> Roblox, launched in 2006 by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, is a leading online platform where users
		create, share, and play games developed by other users. Known for its user-generated content,
		Roblox offers a game engine called Roblox Studio, where games are built using the Lua
		programming language. The platform has grown massively, particularly among younger audiences,
		and supports cross-platform play on devices like PCs, smartphones, and consoles. Roblox's virtual
		currency, Robux, allows creators to monetize their games, and the platform went public in 2021.
		Today, Roblox is not just a gaming hub but also a social and educational tool, hosting virtual events
		and fostering creativity. </p>
